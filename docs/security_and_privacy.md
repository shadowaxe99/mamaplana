# Security and Privacy

The AI Scheduling Assistant is designed with a strong focus on security and privacy. We understand the importance of protecting user data and ensuring privacy compliance.

## Data Encryption

We implement robust security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit, to protect user data. The `encryptData()` function in `src/security.py` is used to encrypt user data before storing it. Similarly, the `decryptData()` function is used to decrypt the data when it needs to be accessed.

## Compliance with Privacy Regulations

Our AI Scheduling Assistant is designed to comply with relevant data privacy regulations. User data is handled and stored securely, and we ensure that we obtain necessary user consent before collecting and processing their data.

## User Account Management

User account management is handled securely. The `src/user_account.py` file contains the `UserSchema` which defines the structure for user account data. The `loginUser()` and `signupUser()` functions are used to log in and sign up users securely.

## Email Integration

Email interactions and scheduling-related communications are managed securely through integration with popular email platforms. The `src/email_integration.py` file contains the `EmailSchema` which defines the structure for email data.

## Online and Local Deployment

Whether you choose online deployment or local installation, we ensure that your data is secure. The `deployOnline()` and `deployLocal()` functions in `src/web_interface.py` and `src/local_version.py` respectively, handle the deployment securely.

## Testing

We perform rigorous testing to ensure the security and privacy of our application. The `testFunctionality()` function in the `src/tests/test_security.py` file is used to test the security functionalities of our application.

## Future Enhancements

We plan for future enhancements to further strengthen the security and privacy of our application. You can find more details in the `docs/future_enhancements.md` file.

## Release and Deployment Process

Our release and deployment process includes versioning, testing, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth and efficient deployments. The `releaseVersion()` and `deployVersion()` functions in `src/deployment_process.py` handle the release and deployment process. More details can be found in the `docs/release_and_deployment.md` file.
