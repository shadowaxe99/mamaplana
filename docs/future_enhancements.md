# Future Enhancements

## Email Platform Integration

We plan to extend the AI Scheduling Assistant's capabilities by integrating additional email platforms. This will allow users to manage their scheduling tasks across multiple email accounts, providing a more comprehensive and convenient scheduling experience.

## Language Support

To make the AI Scheduling Assistant accessible to a wider audience, we aim to support more languages. This will involve enhancing the NLP engine (`src/nlp_engine.py`) to understand and generate responses in multiple languages.

## Scheduling Tool Integration

We are looking to expand the AI Scheduling Assistant's integration options with other scheduling tools. This will enable users to manage their schedules across different platforms seamlessly, further enhancing the scheduling automation feature.

## User Interface Improvements

Based on user feedback and usability studies, we will continue to refine and improve the user interface. This includes both the web interface (`src/web_interface.py`) and the interface for the local version (`src/local_version.py`).

## Security Enhancements

Security is a top priority for us. We will continue to implement robust security measures (`src/security.py`) and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. Future enhancements may include advanced encryption methods and additional user account security features (`src/user_account.py`).

## Agile Development Methodologies

We will continue to follow Agile development methodologies (`src/agile_methods.py`) for iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous improvement. This includes regular sprints, backlog grooming, and retrospectives to ensure we are always delivering the best possible product to our users.

## Release and Deployment Process

We will refine our release and deployment process (`src/deployment_process.py`) to ensure smooth and efficient deployments. This includes improving our versioning, testing (`src/tests/`), and CI/CD pipelines.
