# Development Methodology

Our AI Scheduling Assistant follows Agile development methodologies for iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous improvement. Here's a brief overview of our approach:

## Agile Development

We use Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to manage our development process. This approach allows us to adapt to changes quickly and deliver incremental improvements to our users.

### Scrum

In Scrum, we organize our work into "sprints," which are fixed-length iterations of one to two weeks. Each sprint begins with a planning meeting, where we decide what work will be done in the upcoming sprint. The work is then divided into tasks, which are assigned to team members.

At the end of each sprint, we hold a review meeting to discuss what was accomplished and a retrospective meeting to reflect on how the sprint went and how we can improve.

### Kanban

In Kanban, we visualize our workflow using a Kanban board. Each task is represented by a card that moves from one column to the next as it progresses through the development process.

Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not have fixed-length iterations. Instead, work is continuously delivered as it's completed.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We use CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of our code. This allows us to catch and fix bugs quickly and ensures that our users always have access to the latest features and improvements.

## Testing

We write automated tests for all our code to ensure it works as expected. These tests are run every time we make changes to our codebase, helping us catch and fix issues early.

## Code Reviews

Before any code is merged into our main codebase, it undergoes a code review. This process helps us maintain a high standard of code quality and catch potential issues before they become problems.

## Regular Feedback

We value feedback from our users and use it to guide our development process. By listening to our users, we can ensure that we're building features that meet their needs and improve their experience with our AI Scheduling Assistant.
